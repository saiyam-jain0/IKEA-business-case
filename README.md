# IKEA Business Case

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing and refining my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) skills using a simulated dataset from IKEA. The dataset includes one day of individual product transactions from a retail store, with data on customer demographics and purchasing behavior. The primary goal is to analyze this data to uncover insights, segment customers, and predict customer characteristics, particularly focusing on whether customers have children.
